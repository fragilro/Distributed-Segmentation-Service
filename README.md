ITK-SNAP Distributed Segmentation Service (DSS) Middleware Layer
=====
This is the source code of the middleware layer for the ITK-SNAP distributed segmentation service (DSS). [ITK-SNAP](itksnap.org) is an interactive tool for segmentation of volumetric medical imaging datasets, like CT and MRI. DSS is a web-based application that allows scientists to make their advanced image processing algorithms available as services to ITK-SNAP users. The main "production" DSS service is running at [https://dss.itksnap.org].

This repository includes a **docker-compose.yml** script that makes it possible to run your own local instance of the DSS middleware layer. This is intended for testing out services before submitting them for production. For more information about creating and testing services, see the documentation.
